  Comment Hachyderm modérateurs/trices modère Hachyderm.

This is the set of principles that Hachyderm moderators agree to
inform their decisions and judgment calls when
creating and maintaining Hachyderm as a safe space and enforcing
server rules. This is because first and foremost:

> Hachyderm moderators acknowledge the importance of server rules /
> Codes of Conduct that are complete and clear. Hachyderm moderators
> _also_ acknowledge that the entirety of human behavior cannot be
> captured by an itemized list, no matter how many subsections it has, and
> therefore use the following principles to ensure that we are
> _always_ able to take action even in situations where a reported
> infraction “falls between the cracks”.

1. **We will prioritize the vulnerable.**<br />All actions we take will prioritize the most vulnerable, full stop.
1. **We acknowledge that we will make mistakes.**<br />
We acknowledge that we are not infallible. We will constantly be
learning and growing and will respond to our mistakes with
acknowledgement, care, and do what is necessary to undo or
mitigate the harm done.
1. **We will moderate with respect.**<br />
We will handle our communications with users and accounts that
have been reported for moderation with respect.
1. **We acknowledge and understand that we are strangers on this pale blue dot.**<br />
The reality is that the vast majority of user interactions are
between strangers, even if familiarity increases with time. This
means that in almost all reported situations: the reported user is
a stranger to us as moderators and that the reported user is a
stranger to other users in the interaction (on a personal level,
even if the account is recognizable). This means that while we
will look at the reported user on the surface to try and
understand possible intent, we acknowledge that it is not possible
to use intent or presumed / guestimated intent alone to inform
what moderation action(s), if any, to take.
1. **We will prioritize impact over intent.**<br />
Whenever we look into a reported interaction, we look at as much
of the situation we can see. This means we do due diligence on
seeing what, if any, factors are contributing to the situation and
if that situation is escalating or at risk of escalating. Since we
acknowledge that We Are Strangers, that means we are doing this
based on an understanding of people, in general, and the
intersectionalities at play. Regardless of intent or whether
actions and words were purposeful, the targeted or affected person
is still harmed. That's why it is critical to prioritize impact
and acknowledge the harm that was caused.
1. **We will trust, but verify.**<br />
There is a saying that you need to believe someone when they tell
you who they are. Individuals and communities make use of the reporting
feature to tell us about other individuals and/or communities who have
announced who _they_ are in some way so we can take
appropriate action. There is also the rare occasions where
individuals will use the reporting feature(s) as a vector of
harassment or oppression against a targeted user and/or demographic.
We balance these two realities by trusting that reports are
filed with good intention, but verifying every time.
1. **We will hold Hachyderm users accountable for their actions.**<br />
This is specific to the moderation context of when a reported user
is a Hachydermian. When we communicate rule violation(s), we will
also communicate what (if any) actions are needed on your part. To
put it another way: if you acted in a way that requires moderator
attention, you must take action to un-require that attention. The
most common pattern here will be asking you to delete problematic
posts or similar. Note that this will not be done in situations
where it comes into conflict with Prioritizing the Vulnerable or
Making Safety the Sustainable State. Also note that sometimes the
action isn’t deleting posts, but changing a behavior. Two common
patterns here are:
    * Asking a reported user to do some light research into the
      topic area that caused them to be reported. Small steps
      iterating over time increase our collective knowledge and
      our community's ability to be safe and open.
    * Reminding a reported user that they can always walk away
      from an interaction that is not going the way they intend.
1. **We will steward safe spaces to allow for the range of human expression and experience.**<br />
Since people are more likely to report negative emotions and
perspectives than positive, this one will be explained by relevant
examples:
    - We do not moderate people for being angry at systems of oppression
functioning as designed, because that design is traumatic.
    - We do not moderate people for existing in public. This includes,
but is not limited to, “acting Black”, “acting gay”, being visibly
a member of a particular religion, and so on.
1. **We will not create the [Paradox of Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_tolerance).**<br />
Whenever there is a choice that needs to be made between the impact of individual actions 
and community safety, we will choose community safety.
1. **We will only take moderation action where doing so increases
community safety and/or decreases community risk.**<br />
For every report, we do an analysis to determine whether or not taking
moderator action will improve community safety and/or decrease
community risk. If the best action to take is to not react,
then we will not react.<br />
For off server users in particular we _also_ recognize the limits
of what we are able to moderate. Users on the fediverse who did not
agree to our server rules are not subject to them. In these cases
we are solely evaluating what, if any, moderation action will protect
our community and its members rather than evaluating if a user
who never agreed to our specific rules is abiding by them.
1. **We understand that people need space and safety to grow.**<br />
We understand that it is impossible for everyone to know
everything, and that includes us. We do not expect our community
to be experts on every fact of life, or experts in every form of
social interaction. 
1. **We will prioritize making safety the sustainable state.**<br />
We will take actions to prevent users from being reported for the
same, or similar, infractions.
1. **We will take actions to prevent learning at the community’s
expense.**<br />
Specifically:
  - Nous apprendrons et grandirons de façon proactive pour empêcher notre croissance en tant qu’individus et modérateurs/trices de se faire au détriment de la communauté.
	- Nous reconnaissons que lorsqu’un utilisateur a été signalé comme étant nuisible dans la communauté, ils ont déjà causé du mal. Bien que nous comprenions que les Gens ont Besoin de Croître, nous ne permettrons pas que cette croissance se fasse aux dépens de la communauté. Cela signifie que lorsqu’un utilisateur est signalé pour des actions nuisibles et que nous déterminons qu’il y a un risque de comportement futur et/ou que l’utilisateur n’affiche pas un état d’esprit de croissance lorsqu’il a déjà été avisé, nous choisirons des actions qui Priorisent la Sécurité comme État Durable.
