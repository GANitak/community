## The Rules

In accordance with the [Moderator Covenant](./covenant):
> Hachyderm moderators acknowledge the importance of server rules / Codes of Conduct that are complete and clear. Hachyderm moderators also acknowledge that the entirety of human behavior cannot be captured by an itemized list, no matter how many subsections it has, and therefore use [a set of] principles to ensure that we are always able to take action even in situations where a reported infraction “falls between the cracks”.

This means that we will always do our best to take action on reports, but we also acknowledge that there are situations where the rules may not be clear or may not apply. In these cases, we will do our best to take action that is in the spirit of the rules and the spirit of the Hachyderm community. In addtion, we will work to expand and clarify the rules as the community grows and the need change.

## Exceptions
