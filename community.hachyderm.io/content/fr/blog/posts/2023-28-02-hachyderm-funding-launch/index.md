  We've reached another major milestone creating a legal
  entity for Hachyderm, Aurae, and other (future) open source
  projects. As part of that growth, we are retiring Nóva's Ko-Fi.
  Hachyderm can now be supported via direct donations.

Since our massive growth at the end of last year, many of you have asked about ways to donate
beyond Nóva's Ko-Fi. There were a few limitations there, notably the need to create an account
in order to donate. There were a few milestones we needed to hit before we could do this
properly, notably we needed to have an [EIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Employer_Identification_Number)
in order to properly receive donations and pay for services (as an entity).

Well that time has come! Read on to learn about how you can support Hachyderm either 
directly or via Hachyderm's parent organization, the Nivenly Foundation.

## First things first: GitHub Sponsors

As of **_today_** the [Hachyderm GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/hachyderm) is up and
accepting donations! Using GitHub Sponsors you can add a custom amount and donate either once or
monthly. There are a couple of donation tiers that you can choose from as well if you are interested in
shoutouts / thank yous either on Hachyderm or on our [Funding and Thank You page](/docs/thank-you/). In both
cases we'd use your GitHub handle for the shoutout.

### The shoutouts and Thank You page

[#ThankYouThursday](https://hachyderm.io/tags/ThankYouThursday) is a hashtag we're creating today to thank
users for their contributions. Most posts for #ThankYouThursday happen on [Hachyderm's Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io/@hachyderm)
account, but higher donations will be elible for shoutouts on [Kris Nóva's Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io/@nova).

* $7/mo. and higher
    * Get a sponsor badge on your GitHub profile
* $25/mo. and higher **_or_** $100 one-time and higher
    * Get a sponsor badge on your GitHub profile
    * Get a shoutout on the Hachyderm account's quarterly #ThankYouThursday
* $50/mo. and higher **_or_** $300 one-time and higher
    * Get a sponsor badge on your GitHub profile
    * Get a shoutout on the Kris Nóva's account's quarterly #ThankYouThursday
* $1000 one-time and higher
    * Get a sponsor badge on your GitHub profile
    * Get a shoutout on the Hachyderm account's quarterly #ThankYouThursday
    * Be added to the [Thank You List on our Funding page](/docs/thank-you)
* $2500 one-time and higher
    * Get a sponsor badge on your GitHub profile
    * Get a shoutout on Kris Nóva's quarterly #ThankYouThursday

(All above pricing in USD.)

A couple of important things about the above:

* All public announcements are _optional_. You can choose to opt-out by having your donation set to private.
* By default we'll use your GitHub handle for shoutouts. This is easier than reconciling GitHub and Hachyderm handles.
* We may adjust the tiers to make the Thank Yous more frequent.

Right now the above tiers are our best guess, but we may edit the #ThankYouThursday thresholds in particular so
that we can keep a sustainable cadence. Thank you for your patience and understanding with this ❤️


## And now an update for the Nivenly Foundation

For those who don't know: the Nivenly Foundation is the non-profit co-op that we're founding for Hachyderm
and other open source projects like Aurae. The big milestone we reached here is that 1 ) we're an official
non-profit with the State of Washington and 2 ) we have a nice, shiny, EIN which allowed us to start accepting
donations to both the Nivenly Foundation as well as its two projects: Aurae and Hachyderm. For visibility, here
are all the GitHub sponsor links in one place:

* [Nivenly GitHub Sponsor Page](https://github.com/sponsors/nivenly) <i class="fa-brands fa-github ml-1"></i>
* [Hachyderm GitHub Sponsor Page](https://github.com/sponsors/hachyderm) <i class="fa-brands fa-github ml-1"></i>
* [Aurae GitHub Sponsor Page](https://github.com/sponsors/aurae-runtime) <i class="fa-brands fa-github ml-1"></i>

It is also possible to give a custom one-time donation to Nivenly via Stripe:

* [Stripe One-Time Donation](https://donate.stripe.com/3cs8Apb7R6eK3a83cd) <i class="fa-solid fa-credit-card"></i>

Right now only _donations_ are open for Nivenly, Aurae, and Hachyderm. After we finalize Nivenly's launch,
Nivenly memberships will **_also_** be available for individuals, maintainers, and what we call trade memberships
for companies, businesses, and business-like entities.

### What do Nivenly Memberships mean for donations?

Right now, donations and memberships are separate. That means that you can donate to Hachyderm and, once available,
join Nivenly as two separate steps. As Nivenly's largest project, providing governance and funding for Hachyderm
uses almost all of Nivenly's donations. As we grow and include more
projects this is likely to shift over time. As such, we are spinning up an [Open Collective page for Nivenly](https://opencollective.com/nivenly-foundation) that will manage the memberships and also provide a way for us to be transparent about
our budget as we grow. Our next two big milestones:

* What you've all been waiting for: the public release of the governance model (almost complete)
* What we definitely need: the finalization of our 501(c)3 paperwork with the IRS (in progress)

As we grow we'll continue to post updates. Thank you all so much for your patience and participation 💕

## P.S. and update: What's happening with Ko-fi?

We are currently moving away from Kris Nóva's Ko-fi as a funding source for Nivenly and Hachyderm et al.
We've created a **_new_** Ko-fi account for the Nivenly Foundation itself:

* [Nivenly Foundation Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/nivenly) <i class="far fa-coffee"></i>

Kris Nóva's Ko-fi is still live to give people time to migrate Nivenly-specific donations (including those
for Hachyderm and Aurae) from her Ko-fi to either GitHub sponsors, Nivenly's Ko-fi, Stripe or starting
a Nivenly co-op general membership via Nivenly's Open Collective page as those become ready (which should be soon).
We'll still be using Nivenly-specific funds from her Ko-fi for Nivenly for the next 30-60 days
and will follow up with an update as we start to stop that (manual 😅) process.
