issues related to these features and/or processes, please reach out to the Mastodon team
directly on [the Mastodon project's GitHub](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon).

The documentation in this section is meant to supplement, not supplant, [Mastodon's
documentation at docs.joinmastodon.org](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/). We are choosing
to write clarifications around the Mastodon UI and features that are either frequently
used by the Hachyderm community or provide added clarity for any features that we
require our users to make use of.
