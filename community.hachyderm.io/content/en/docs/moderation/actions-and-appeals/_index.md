   Information about the different actions that moderators
   take and what to do if you've been moderated.

Here you will find everything you need to know about what to do if you've
been moderated, including:

* The specific actions we take and what they mean or imply
* How to appeal and how we work around limitations with the appeal process
  
## First things first <!-- omit in toc -->

We acknowledge that being moderated can be stressful. We do our best to
intervene only when necessary and in the interest of preserving Hachyderm as
a safe space. We acknowledge that we are human and that we can make errors.
We ask for your patience and understanding that when we approach a
situation, we are doing so as strangers moderating strangers. 

For more information about what goes into how we interpret and enforce our rules,
please take a look at our [Moderator Covenant](../covenant/) and
[Rule Explainer](../../rule-explainer/). Some of the language used below
will come from the Moderator Covenant in particular.

## The moderation actions and information about them

Although there are a few actions we can take as moderators, the most common
are:

* Warn
* Freeze
* Suspend

Two additional, less commonly used, actions are:

* Limit
* Delete Posts

### Warn

The warning feature is a tool in the Mastodon admin tools that allows us
to send a message directly to you.

When you receive a warning, that means that the moderation team has decided:

* The impact of what you were reported for did not require a more significant
  intervention, and ...
* ...based on the interaction(s), we believe that you will respond to the
  warning with a growth mindset.

Essentially, warnings are the feature that allow us to respond to a report
with a gentle nudge in the right direction. Warnings do not change your
login, use, or ability to federate as a Hachyderm user.

It is important to understand that, unlike some other systems, a "warning"
is not something that is tracked for later punishment. This means that you
are not accruing "strikes", or similar, with every warning you receive.
That said, please do keep in mind that we choose our actions to prevent
recurrence of the same actions that have caused the community harm. So while
there is not a strike system, this is not leeway to continue to do what you
were reported for without change.

When the moderation team sends a warning, we always send a message with
what we need from you. This may be a reminder to leave interactions that
are not going how you hope or intend, or it may be a reminder to disengage
if you've been asked to leave a conversation for whatever reason.

### Freeze and Suspend

These are both actions that prevent you from using your Hachyderm account
normally. 

* Freeze<br />
  You will be able to log in, but will only be able to access your
  account settings with a message that your account is still otherwise
  online. Basically this means that to an outside observer your account
  is still "up".
* Suspend<br />
  When your account is suspended it will be taken offline. Your data
  including media, posts, followers, and following will all be intact
  for 30 days. After 30 days, they are automatically purged from the
  server after that time.

In all except the most egregious situations, whether a moderator suspends
or freezes an account is based on what we are seeing in the reported
interaction. Specifically:

* How severe is the impact of the reported interaction to our
  community and other communities
* Is the situation continuing to escalate, or at risk of doing so
   * Which action, freeze or suspend, reduces the risk to our community and others

If your account was frozen, you should always file an appeal. If your account
was suspended, the situation of the suspension will determine if an
appeal is possible. ([Skip to The Appeals Process](#the-appeals-process))

We want to call out that there are times that we temporarily suspend an account
even if the rule broken is not severe. This would only happen when there is an
impact to the server or community that would warrant and benefit
from an immediate, visible, action and forced cool-down period.

### Limit and Delete Post

Being limited means that you are hidden on our instance. Your posts
are all still visible to your followers and can still be discovered
when directly searched for. Your posts will not otherwise show up
in the Local feed. You will be able to federate with other instances
normally.

Delete Post is what it sounds like - we can delete the reported posts
and associated media (if that media is uploaded to Hachyderm).

We do not typically Limit accounts or Delete Posts. We have a couple of
reasons for this:

* We do not want the moderation process to be passive; essentially,
  if you acted in a way that required intervention, we want to see
  that you are willing and able to rectify the situation without
  further intervention.
* In the case of Limit in particular, we do not want the process
  to go on without resolution.

This means that, in general, we will use one of the other actions and
communicate what we'd need from you in an appeal process to reinstate
normal functioning of your account.

## Reminder: not all moderation action is visible

Of the above actions, the only moderation actions that are visible
are if a moderator deletes a post or suspends an account. When an
issue is closed without action or when a user is warned, frozen, or
limited, the action is not visible to the reporting user or other
users.

## The Appeals Process

You may respond to any moderator action with an appeal. In all cases except for
1 ) severe rule violations or 2 ) creating a banned account type
it is in your interest to file an appeal to start or continue a conversation
about what you reported for.

#### When not to appeal ?

The only two situations when filing an appeal will not be helpful. If
the harm done to the community is repetitive (before it was caught) and
the impact and risk to the community is high, there is no benefit to you
filing an appeal. This includes, but is not limited to, being in favor
of systems of oppression, posting illegal content, harassment, etc.

The other situation is if the account is a type that we ban on our
server and it was correctly flagged (please file an appeal if not).
Common types of banned account types are NSFW and fundraising.

For clarity: if your account was suspended (or frozen) due to being either
1 ) an unrecognized special account type or 2 ) not following the rules
for your account type (bots, companies, etc.) then you _should_ file an
appeal.

#### When to appeal ?

If the reason that your account was flagged for a rule violation was
incorrect, you _should_ file an appeal. We again ask for patience and
understanding as we work with you to correct our mistake in that case.

Some cases for something like this:

* An account that is flagged as a company or business (a corporate account),
  but is not.
* An account that is a specialized account type, but one that is not directly
  allowed from our [Account Types](../../account-types/). Currently, accounts that are not
  specifically called out are not allowed. We request and recommend everyone
  interested in creating accounts that are in a grey area to reach out to
  us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).

There are other cases where we use freeze and suspend as tools to help
de-escalate or otherwise resolve a situation in progress, but the freeze
or suspension does not need to be permanent. Example situations for this:

* A specialized account type not following the rules for that account type.
  (e.g. bot posting more than the limit, not using hashtags, etc.)
* If a situation is escalating in a way that cannot be resolved without
  stopping what is happening while in progress. (e.g. A user
  accidentally spamming the server due to something misconfigured.)

Where possible and applicable, we try to include whatever needs to happen
to unfreeze or unsuspend an account. Commonly, with frozen accounts, we may
need you to agree to delete posts or similar to re-instate your account.

Whenever you file an appeal you should always email us due to limitations
in the appeals process. (See next section.)

### Limitations of the appeals process

Whenever you want to file an appeal you should _both_ file the appeal _and_
email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).

The reason for this is that the Appeal feature in the admin interface
does not allow us to continue a conversation with you. When we receive an
appeal we can _only_ Approve or Reject. We cannot send an outbound
communication when we do either action and cannot send a communication
to help us decide what action to take.

In order for us to know if your account was flagged incorrectly and why,
or for us to be able to reinstate your account if it was frozen or suspended
pending action we requested of you, we will need you to email us at
[admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io). Please also include a
summary of the situation in the appeal itself, as that will remain
tied with the appeal in admin UI, which will set the initial context
and set the expectation that there are emails corresponding to the appeal.
