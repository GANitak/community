Curated accounts are accounts that post content on a regular basis that
the account owner(s) have previously vetted. This can include, but is not
limited to:

* Job postings for a specific profession, industry, or from a particular source
* Newsletter or newsletter-like postings relevant to a particular profession or industry
* Podcasts or other streaming focused content
* Conference aggregators for CFPs, tickets, sign-up date(s), etc.

## Restrictions on behavior

Curated posts, whether they are a dedicated account type or an account that features
them prominently, have restrictions on this server.

* Curated accounts must be "on topic". To put it another way, they must be directly relevant
  to the tech industry.
* Curated accounts must follow the same posting rules as [automated posts](../bot-accounts/#posting-rules).</br>
  Notably this includes:
    * **There is an upper limit of 5 curated/scheduled/automated posts per day. Lower is better.**
    * Posts cannot violate other rules
      * This includes server rules around, monetary posts, spam disallowance, NSFW/18+ content (et al)
      * Hybrid accounts, those that make use of curated content and are also another specialized type,
        are bound to all sets of rules for their combined, hybrid, account type.
      * Posts cannot violate the [Specialized Account Expectations](../covenant/)
    * Similar to bots, curated accounts must use the `#hachygrator` hashtag ("Hachyderm" + "Aggregator") in their posts to allow users to opt-in or opt-out.
* Curated accounts must be [verified with Hachyderm](../verification/)
* Where applicable, accounts should [be verified](../../mastodon/user/verification/)
  with their relevant domain(s).
