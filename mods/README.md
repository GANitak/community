# Hachyderm Moderators

## Benevolent Dictator (Moderator) for Life

Quintessence Anx, or [quintessence on both Hachyderm](https://hachyderm.io/@quintessence) and Discord.

## Translation Assistance Moderators

Moderation on Hachyderm is mostly done in English; however, to help moderate
posts in languages other than English, we have translation assistance
volunteers. These are people who speak fluently / nearly fluently the languages
indicated next to their names. It's important to note that in situations when
an issue is reported to mods in one of these languages that we will be pulling
in these volunteers as temporary mods in those circumstances. When that happens,
they will be considered moderators and bound by the same rules around privacy
that bind our full time moderators.

If you are fluent in a language other than English and would like to assist,
please either submit a pull request and add yourself to the list or open a
GitHub issue for one of us to do so. We encourage multiple speakers of the same
language to volunteer in case one or more people are not available. Please note
that you will need to be in the accompanying Nivenly Discord so we can reach
you with questions if/when they arise. [You can join the Nivenly Discord here](https://discord.com/invite/YnWdbchSwA).

When you add yourself to this list please make sure to include your name or
handle, whichever you prefer / are recognized by, your Hachyderm username,
your handle on the Nivenly Discord, and leave a blank line to make it easier
for the next person to add themself.
